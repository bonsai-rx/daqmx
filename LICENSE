You agree, throughout the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, not to: (a) use NI’s Confidential Information for any purpose, other than for the Authorized Purpose; and/or (b) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise analyze the underlying ideas or structure of NI’s Confidential Information. Any Confidential Information you receive or may provide NI as part of the engagement in this Agreement shall not be disclosed to any third party, except that NI shall be entitled to share Confidential Information it received from you with its affiliates and their sub-contractors, employees, consultants or agents who (i) have a legitimate “need to know” to accomplish the Authorized Purpose, and (ii) are obligated to protect such Confidential Information pursuant to terms and conditions no less protective than those contained in this Agreement. You shall protect NI’s Confidential Information as required hereunder using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, as you use to protect your own confidential information of a like nature. For clarity, you agree to treat the Software as NI’s proprietary and confidential information hereunder. The obligations set forth in this Section 13 shall not apply to information that can be proved by substantive evidence that: (a) was already known to you without any prior obligation of confidentiality; (b) is or becomes available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain without breach of this Agreement; (c) is rightfully received at any time by you from a third party without an obligation of confidentiality; (d) is disclosed by NI to a third party without an obligation of confidentiality; or (e) is independently developed by you.

14.	Limited Warranty. NI warrants, for your benefit alone, that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date the Software is shipped to you or, if downloaded, from the date the Software is first downloaded by you, (i) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the performance specifications set forth in the documentation that accompanies the Software, and (ii) the installation media on which NI provides the Software (if any) will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service (collectively, the "Limited Warranty"). Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of or limitation on duration of an express or implied warranty or limitation on any applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the above limitations may not apply to you; in such event, such warranties are limited to the minimum warranty period allowed by applicable law. The Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, improper calibration by you, third party products (either hardware or software) used by you that are not intended by NI for use with the Software, utilization of an improper hardware or software key, or unauthorized maintenance of the Software.

15.	Customer Remedies. NI's sole obligation and liability, and your sole remedy, with respect to the foregoing Limited Warranty will be to, at NI's option, repair or replace the Software or return the pro-rated fees paid by you to NI for the Software license in which event you must return or destroy all copies of the Software in accordance with NI's instructions and the License granted to you will terminate without liability on the part of NI by reason of such termination. NI's obligations as set forth in this Section are contingent on you providing NI with written notice of applicable defects during the warranty period. In addition, you must obtain a Return Material Authorization number from NI before returning the Software under warranty to NI, and you agree to pay any expenses for shipment to and from NI.

THERE ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING. NI DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET POSSESSION, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE AND ANY RELATED THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, SOURCE CODE, AND SOFTWARE SERVICES.

17.	Limitations Period. You hereby agree not to bring an action to enforce your remedies under the Limited Warranty or for breach of warranty more than one (1) year after the accrual of such cause of action. 

18.	Intellectual Property Liability. NI will, at its own expense, defend any claim brought against you by a third party resulting from your use of the Software, to the extent that such claim alleges that the Software infringes any patent, copyright, or trademark of such third party protected by the laws of the U.S.A., Canada, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, Norway, or the European Union and provided that such claim does not arise from (i) your use of the Software in combination with equipment, devices, software, or code not made by NI; (ii) your use of the Software in a manner not in accordance with this Agreement or for a purpose not intended by NI; (iii) your failure to incorporate Software updates or upgrades provided by NI that would have avoided the alleged infringement; or (iv) any modification of the Software not made by NI.

If you provide to NI the authority, assistance, and information NI needs to defend or settle such claim, NI will pay any final award of damages or settlement with respect to such claim and any expense you incur at NI's written request. NI will not be liable for a settlement made without its prior written consent. If the Software is held to be infringing of the rights stated above in this Section and the use of the Software is enjoined, NI will, or if NI believes the Software might be held to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights NI may, at its option, (i) procure for you the right to use the Software; (ii) replace or modify the Software with other software that does not infringe; or (iii) receive your return of the infringing Software and refund to you the license fee payment made by you to NI for the Software. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NI'S LIABILITY, THE LIABILITY OF ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS, AND THE LIABILITY OF ITS AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS, UNDER THIS SECTION (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LIABILITY) AND REGARDLESS OF THE REASON FOR SUCH LIABILITY, WILL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE $50,000 (U.S.). The foregoing states your sole remedy for, and NI's sole liability and obligation for, infringement of any patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual or industrial property right relating to the Software. THIS LIMITED INDEMNITY IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT. THE FOREGOING OBLIGATIONS WILL NOT APPLY TO ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS INCORPORATED IN OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED WITH THE SOFTWARE, AND YOU AGREE TO LOOK TO THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS FOR INFRINGEMENT INVOLVING THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS.

19.	Limitation On Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NI OR ITS LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, OR SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING NI'S AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) BE LIABLE UNDER, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY: (A) INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (B) DAMAGES ARISING FROM LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, WASTE EXPENDITUE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOST OR DAMAGED REPUTATION OR GOODWILL, OR LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA OR SOFTWARE; OR (C) THE COST OF PROCURING ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 18, IN NO EVENT WILL NI'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT RECEIVED BY NI FROM YOU FOR THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE LICENSE (FOR A TERM LICENSE, THIS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE CURRENT TERM). THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATION SHALL APPLY: (i) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW; (ii) EVEN IF NI HAS BEEN ADVISED, OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE, OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSSES, DAMAGES, OR COSTS; (iii) EVEN IF ANY REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; AND (iv) REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OR BASIS OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR NEGLIGENCE OR BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY), STRICT LIABILITY, MISREPRESENTATION, RESTITUTION, OR OTHERWISE. 

You acknowledge that the applicable fees and prices reflect this allocation of risk.

2.	Term. The VLP will be effective commencing as of the date that NI sends the VLP Startup Kit to you ("VLP Effective Date"). The initial term of the VLP (the "Initial VLP Term") will start on the VLP Effective Date and continue for a period of one (1) year in the event you subscribed for an annual license. In the event you subscribed for a multi-year license, the Initial VLP Term will continue until the lapse of any such multi-year term specified in your Quote and you may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to NI to be sent at least sixty (60) days before the end of any annual term during the VLP Term. You shall not be entitled to any refund in the event of early termination. Upon the end of the Initial VLP Term, you may renew the VLP for additional one (1) year periods (the Initial VLP Term and each such renewal term each shall be referred to herein as a "VLP Term"). 

3.	Software under the VLP may be used by your employees only on those computers located at the location to which NI delivers the Software unless otherwise specified in the VLP Documentation (the "Site"). The definition of "Site" will also include all of your locations located within the same country as the Site. In addition, (i) if your Site is located in North or South America, then all of your locations within North and South America will be considered in the same country; (ii) if your Site is located in Europe, Middle East, India, or Africa (including Russia and Mongolia), then any of your locations within the foregoing regions will be considered in the same country; and (iii) if your Site is located in Asia Pacific, then all of your locations in the region will be considered located in the same country. If you purchase a global VLP, then all of your locations worldwide will be considered in the same country as the Site; provided, however, that the Software must be managed from the region to which NI delivers the Software. Your use of the Software under the VLP will, at all times during the VLP Term and thereafter, be subject to all terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement regarding the specific type of license you have acquired under the VLP (i.e. named user, computer-based, or concurrent).

4.	 You must acquire and maintain during the VLP Term the Subscription or the Software Services for each individual Software license identified in the VLP Documentation and for which NI makes such Subscription or Software Services available. Software Services will be described in the VLP Documentation. NI reserves the right to restrict Software Service to the then most current version of the Software that is commercially available. You understand that NI may not make available Software Service or Subscription for all Software available under the VLP. Unless otherwise agreed to by NI in writing, you must maintain during the VLP Term a minimum of five (5) licenses of the same Term type to a version of a single NI software product that is considered by NI to be a development version.

5.	You must designate an individual in your organization who is responsible for distributing and overseeing the installation and use of the Software, including use of any master installation media and installation and maintenance of any approved volume license manager, ("Software Administrator") for each Site.

An "Approved Volume License Manager" means NI's computer software for controlling end user access to the Software and that generates applicable usage compliance information ("NI VLM"); FlexNet software; or any other third party software approved in writing by NI for controlling end user access to the Software. If the Approved Volume License Manager is the NI VLM or if NI makes documentation available for the applicable Approved Volume License Manager, such Approved Volume License Manager must be installed and used in accordance with the documentation provided by NI.

8.	If you have existing computer-based or named user licenses for the Software that are to be covered by the VLP, you must notify NI in writing of the product, platform, and serial number information for each such license. Each such covered license and the individual serial number for each such license will, as of the VLP Effective Date, no longer be in effect and will be superseded by the licenses within the VLP, which will have a single, common serial number. You must provide NI with any information reasonably requested by NI in order to establish and administer the VLP. You understand that not all available existing Software is coverable by a VLP.

9.	Concurrent Use License. If you have obtained a concurrent use license under the VLP, you will be bound by the terms for concurrent use licenses, except that the “Site” for the licenses shall be as defined in this Addendum for licenses under a VLP. If you have purchased a global concurrent license, then all of your locations worldwide will be considered in the same country as the Site.

10.	You acknowledge and agree that in no event may your use of the Software under the VLP exceed the maximum total number of licenses set forth in the VLP Documentation in addition to any licenses that may be added to the VLP after the VLP Effective Date and any licenses available through the "Overdraft" feature. You agree to pay for licenses accessed through the Overdraft feature.

11.	Activity Compliance Logs. Upon request, you agree to provide an activity compliance log ("Activity Compliance Log") for each Site to NI promptly. The Activity Compliance Log must be in a format acceptable to NI.
